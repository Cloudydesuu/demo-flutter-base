# Flutter Apps with Firebase & Supabase

This repository contains two Flutter applications demonstrating integration with Firebase and Supabase, both configured with environment variables using dotenv for secure configuration management.

## Applications

### Firebase App

A Flutter application integrated with Firebase services, featuring:

- Firebase Core initialization
- Environment-based configuration
- Secure credential management

### Supabase App

A Flutter application integrated with Supabase, featuring:

- Supabase client initialization
- Environment-based configuration
- Secure credential management

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (3.24.0 or later)
- Dart SDK
- Android Studio / VS Code
- Git

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. **Setup Firebase App:**

   ```bash
   cd firebase_app
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your Firebase configuration
   flutter pub get
   flutter run
   ```

3. **Setup Supabase App:**
   ```bash
   cd supabase_app
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your Supabase configuration
   flutter pub get
   flutter run
   ```

## CI/CD Pipeline

This repository includes comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows:

### Flutter CI (`flutter-ci.yml`)

- **Triggers:** Push/PR to main/develop branches
- **Jobs:**
  - Code analysis for both apps
  - Code formatting checks

### Code Quality (`code-quality.yml`)

- **Triggers:** Push/PR + Daily scheduled runs
- **Features:**
  - Advanced code analysis with fatal info checks
  - Dependency vulnerability scanning
  - Security scanning with Trivy

## Security

- Environment variables are properly configured in `.gitignore`
- Sensitive credentials are never committed to version control
- Security scanning is integrated into the CI pipeline
- Dependency vulnerability checks run daily
